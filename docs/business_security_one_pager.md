# Security & Trust: A Business Overview

## Your Data, Secured.

At CoPromote, we understand that trust is the currency of our business. We have built our platform from the ground up to exceed the security standards required by modern enterprise retailers.

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Protection
We use the same security infrastructure trusted by Fortune 500 companies.
*   **Bank-Level Encryption**: Your customer data is encrypted when it moves and when it sits in our vault. Even if someone stole the hard drive, they couldn't read your data.
*   **Strict Isolation**: Your company's data is physically isolated from other companies. Think of it as having your own private vault in our bank, not just a folder in a shared filing cabinet.

### 🤖 AI Safety & Brand Reputation
We know you are handing your brand voice to an AI. We take that responsibility seriously.
*   **Guardrails, Not Just Scripts**: Our AI is programmed with strict "Guardrails" that prevent it from discussing sensitive topics like politics or religion. It stays professional, always.
*   **Privacy First**: We do not store sensitive credit card information in our AI logs. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling is compliant with privacy laws.

### ✅ Compliance Ready
We help you check the boxes for your legal and compliance teams.
*   **GDPR / CCPA**: We support "Right to be Forgotten" and data export requests out of the box.
*   **Reliability**: 99.9% Uptime SLA ensures we are there when your customers need us.

### 🔑 You Control Access
*   **Role-Based Access**: You decide who sees what. Give your agents access to call lists without giving them access to billing or settings.
*   **Audit Trails**: (Enterprise) See exactly who did what and when, for complete accountability.
